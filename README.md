## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person.
- **Bonus 1 (Done!)**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser.
- **Bonus 2 (Done!)**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win.
